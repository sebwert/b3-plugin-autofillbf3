Autofill Battlefield 3 for Big Brother Bot
==========================================


Description
-----------

This plugin changes the available slots according to the acctual
connected player. The idea behind this is to get more quickmatch user.

The initial forum thread can be found at:
http://forum.bigbrotherbot.net/battle-field-3/script-for-server-filling/

- The available slots will always be 2 more than the connected player.
- If ``adjust_start_restart_payer_count`` is set to ``On`` in config it will
  change roundStartPlayerCount/roundRestartPlayerCount to 8/4 after the
  round started and set it to 1/0 when the round ends.
- If ``change_maps`` is set to ``On`` and you have two map files and 
  write their correct absolute pathes to ``maps_many``, ``maps_few`` 
  this plugin will change your map rotation when the number of connected user
  falls under/growth over your ``maps_border``


Installation
------------

- copy extplugins stuff into b3/extplugins
- add to the plugins section of your main b3 config file: 
``<plugin name="autofillbf3" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/plugin_autofillbf3.xml" />``

Map Files:
~~~~~~~~~~

At this time it is important, that your map file does not contain any empty lines
or any lines with another beginning as "mapname gamemode rounds". Only the 
battlefield 3 server map names are allowed!

MP_003 ConquestSmall0 1         #Theran Highway

The line above is allowd cause the parser will stop after the number of rounds. 
There you can write comments

#Theran Highway  MP_003 ConquestSmall0 1

The line above will lead to an error cause the parser is not able to recognise
that the first element is not the map name

You should have recieved a ``maps.dist`` file and a ``maps.all.txt`` file with 
this plugin. The maps.dist file is an example of how an maps file could look like.
No empty lines and the fomat described above. The maps.all.txt file is a file with
all combinations of game modes and map names that are allowed in battlefield 3 at the
time. please have a speacial look at the expansion set maps.
